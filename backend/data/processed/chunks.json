    "text": "Sunrise Bakery has been serving the community with fresh, delicious baked goods since 1985. Founded by Maria Rodriguez, a third-generation baker, our bakery combines traditional European baking techniques with modern innovation. Our Story:\nMaria learned the art of bread-making from her grandmother in Italy before moving to the United States. She opened Sunrise Bakery with a single oven and a dream to share her family's baking traditions with the local community. Today, we operate three locations while maintaining the same commitment to quality and craftsmanship that defined our humble beginnings. Our Philosophy:\n- Use only the finest ingredients sourced locally when possible\n- Bake fresh daily with no preservatives or artificial additives\n- Create a welcoming environment for all our customers\n- Support local farmers and suppliers.",
