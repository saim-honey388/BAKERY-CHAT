## ðŸ“Š **Dual-API Weight System Implementation:**

### **Memory Weight Hierarchy:**
1. **Cart State & Info (100% weight)**: Always preserved, highest priority
2. **Last 10 Messages (80% weight)**: 5 user + 5 bot exchanges, high priority
3. **Important Features (60% weight)**: Accumulated key details, medium priority
4. **Conversation Summary (40% weight)**: Long-term preferences, lower priority

### **Dual-API Feature Accumulation Strategy:**
- **Growing Feature Set**: Accumulate important features throughout conversation
- **Importance Scoring**: Prioritize user preferences, key decisions, important details
- **Feature Compression**: Maintain feature quality while managing size
- **Preference Tracking**: Capture likes/dislikes, dietary restrictions, etc.
- **Enhanced API Context Extraction**: Use Enhanced API for complex context understanding
- **Primary API Responses**: Use Primary API for general responses and simple queries

### **Dual-API Usage Strategy (Clarified Flow):**

**API Key 1 (Enhanced) - Context Extraction:**
- Extract conversation summary from last 10 messages
- Extract cart info and state
- Extract important features (preferences, habits, patterns)
- Apply rule-based analysis
- Create structured memory context

**API Key 2 (Primary) - Response Generation:**
- Generate final response based on assigned memory context
- Use agent-specific memory allocation
- Respond to user's new query with full context

**Controller Memory Distribution:**
- **General Info Agent**: Summary + Last 10 messages + Rule base
- **Product Info Agent**: Summary + Last 10 messages + Important features + Database + Rule base + Cart info  
- **Order Agent**: Summary + Last 10 messages + Cart state (1st priority) + Important features + Database (2nd priority) + Rule base

### **Example Dual-API Enhanced Memory Context:**
```
CART_STATE (100% weight):
- Items: 2x Chocolate Cake, 1x Coffee
- Total: $45.00
- Customer: John, Phone: 555-1234
- Fulfillment: Pickup at Downtown branch

LAST_10_MESSAGES (80% weight):
- User: "I want to order a chocolate cake"

- User: "2 please, and a coffee"
- Bot: "Added to cart. Pickup or delivery?"
- User: "Pickup at downtown"
- Bot: "Perfect! What's your name for the order?"
- User: "John"
- Bot: "Thanks John! What's your phone number?"
- User: "555-1234"
- Bot: "Great! Your order is ready for confirmation."
